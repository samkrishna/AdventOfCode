# Advent of Code

These are solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles.

They are constructed in the following four languages:

- Objective-C
- Swift
- Python 3.x
- Racket

## Structure

Currently, the repo for a given year is organized as follows:

- &lt;year&gt;
- applelang (for both Objective-C and Swift using Xcode IDE)
- python3 (using Wing IDE)
- racket (using DrRacket IDE)

Right now, only 2018 has any entries filled out.

## Motivation

I needed to do *something* to keep pushing my edge in software development. But I didn't want to go out and make up a bunch of exercises that I didn't care about or were artificially simplistic.

I also need to get WAY BETTER at Python, Racket and Swift (I already develop in Objective-C). I'm using Objective-C as a baseline strategy to help me "navigate the solution" and then use the language idiosyncrasies for the other languages to bootstrap their solutions.

## Goals

The goal is to work through all 4 years in all 4 languages before the 2019 AoC project rolls around. After that front-line work is complete, hopefully I'll be working on the 2019 AoC problems as well.
